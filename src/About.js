    <p> <b>I am a motivated Informal School of IT JavaScript graduate looking to learn more in a team 
        during an internship.</b><br/><br/>
        After graduating The Informal School of IT I started  working on this project.<br/>
        In the past I graduated from "Babes-Bolyai" University Faculty of Economics and Business, specialized in Business Management.<br/><br/>
        I have worked several years in different businesses as manager. Throughout these years I've developed many skills.
        Among these are the following: the ability to manage companies on the financial and investment side,
        improvement in communication and relations with clients and potential investors, coordinating employees and activities, 
        finding solutions for unexpected problems that might occured.<br/><br/>
        Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, I found myself with a lot of free time, so I chose to use it for personal development and I took part
        in a JavaScript Development course.
        At the end of the course I realized that I really like working with JavaScript, so I would like to change my career path to 
        JavaScript Developer.<br/><br/>    
        <b>I am actively looking for a Frontend Developer internship where I can develop my skills and work in a team.</b>
